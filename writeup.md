# How do you archive a feeling? Can you lean on the internet to hold your grief for you?
### ideas for this
- a website that prompts the user to download a random piece of the concert onto their computer and deletes it from here, kinda like holding fragments of my joy and grief

### tangible?
- yes permissions might suck but it is doable
- how long? a week of focused coding, two if misery is not a companion
