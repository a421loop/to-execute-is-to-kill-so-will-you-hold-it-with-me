# How do you archive a feeling? Can you lean on the internet to hold your grief for you?
### ideas for this
- a website that prompts the user to download a random piece of the concert onto their computer and deletes it from here, kinda like holding fragments of my joy and grief

### tangible?
- yes permissions might suck but it is doable. prompt it with "do you want to help me hold the loss of the best day of my life?", if they say yes, it loads the archive and they can click on a thing to hold/download onto their computer
- how long? a week of focused coding, two if misery is not a companion

### feedback 
- seems sketchy, people wont want to give permissions| Sure but I am not really making it for everyone. 
- why not tell them what it is in the popup? Na, that defeats the purpose| I want the holders to be humans who care even in the face of ambiguoity
- should incorporate folders for them to explore| Sure sounds fun
- you should not start another project this year|
